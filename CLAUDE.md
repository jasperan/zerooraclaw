# ZeroOraClaw

Oracle AI Database-powered fork of ZeroClaw.

## Architecture

- **Oracle is the ONLY storage backend** -- no SQLite, no PostgreSQL, no markdown
- Rust 1.87+ required
- `oracle` crate (v0.6) for the database driver
- ONNX ALL_MINILM_L12_V2 for in-database embeddings (384-dim vectors)
- All database tables use the prefix `ZERO_*`

## Build & Test

```sh
cargo build --release
cargo test
```

## Conventions

- Do NOT include AI attribution in commit messages (no "Co-Authored-By: Claude", "Generated by Claude", etc.)
- NEVER push to GitHub -- only commit locally. User pushes manually.
- Keep commit messages focused solely on the changes made.
